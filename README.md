# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction using LSTM and Linear Regression

## Project Description

This project aims to predict future prices of cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin) using machine learning models, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Linear Regression. It utilizes historical price data to forecast future prices and provides a web interface for users to select different cryptocurrencies.
